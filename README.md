# Vulkan Renderer

A from-scratch renderer built with C++ and Vulkan.

The project is primarily a learning project focused on understanding Vulkan and GPU rendering at a low level, while gradually building a "functional" game engine.

## Current Progress

* [x] build system
* [x] Win32 abstraction
* [x] Vulkan initialization
* [x] Physical/logical device selection
* [x] Swapchain
* [x] Command recording and submission
* [x] Drawing a triangle :)
* [x] Viewport with ImGui

## Goals

The goal is to keep the renderer relatively small and focused while gaining a deeper understanding of Vulkan, GPU memory, synchronization, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

Feel free to ask me questions or follow along!

## How to Build and Run the Application

### Dependencies and Environment

The renderer currently requires:

* **Windows**
* <strong>Vulkan SDK</strong> <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home</a>
* A GPU with **Vulkan 1.3** 
* **CMake 3.23** or newer
* A **C++20** compatible compiler
* Any CMake-supported build generator

### Build

Configure the project with CMake from the project's root directory:

```bash
cmake -B build
```

This will use CMake's default generator. You can also specify a generator explicitly.

For example, I use **Ninja**:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja
```

Then build the project:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

The generated build files will be placed in the `build` directory.

### Run

After building, run `raytracer.exe` from the generated build directory.
